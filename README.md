# Emotion-Detection
EEG emotion detection uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity and identify emotional states. This non-invasive method records electrical signals via scalp electrodes, capturing changes linked to emotions. By analyzing brainwave patterns, EEG reveals how the brain responds to different emotional stimuli and processes.
